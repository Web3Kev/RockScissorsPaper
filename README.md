------------- MEDIAPIPE HAND-RECOGNITION -------------

This is a Rock Scissors Paper game made using Mediapipe's hand recognition model.
Make a "thumbs up" 👍 to start playing. Do a "vistory sign" ✌️ for scissors, "open palm" ✋ for paper and "closed fist" for rock ✊ after "rock, scissors, paper ... one ... two ... three"
